# Measure

`measure` is a Kotlin library for working with units of measurement that are - for example - used in the power system sector.

## Motivation
Projects often need a way to express different quantities. For example, building software for electric grids one encounters quantities like power, energy, amperage etcetera.

When one choses to represent this quantities as `BigDecimal`, one needs to be very vigilant when calculating with these quantities. It is easy to aid power and energy when they both are represented as a `BigDecimal`, even though it does not make sense on physical grounds.

Rather, one would represents quantities as a multiple of a [*unit of measurement*][wikipedia:unit]. This project provides exactly that.

## Usage
In using *measure* library there are two parts. The generic `Measure` and `Units` provided by the measure library, and the specific units that your project are interested in.

```kotlin
val power: Measure<Power> = 10 * kiloWatt
val duration: Measure<Time> = 15 * minutes

val energy: Measure<Energy> = power * duration

assertThat(energy `as` megaJoule).equals(9 * megaJoule)
```

The code above demonstrates a fully annotated calculation with quantities. Often times the compiler can infer the corresponding types.

## Development
This project is written in [Kotlin][kotlin] and uses [Gradle][gradle] as a build tool. To see which tasks are available run

```
./gradlew tasks
```
